For people that haven't been following the recent rise of AMD Ryzen CPUs in personal computing, AMD has basically come along and given the industry a massive wake-up call. Their main competitor, Intel, had been peddling 4C/8T (4-Core/8-Thread) CPUs as the mainstream since 2010 up to the announcement of Ryzen.

AMD's new offerings are fantastic for what they are, but there's something to be said for buying secondhand. New product releases are typically associated with greater performance at a given price (Nvidia GPU pricing notwithstanding), and this pushes down price for used parts in that segment.

I will share my experience of the last 3 years in the United Kingdom regarding what factors have affected pricing in some segments of the new/ used parts market.

### CPU

Intel released a 2 core / 4 thread (2C/4T) budget CPU, the Pentium G4560, in Q1 2017. It offered such good value at it's MSRP of £55 that within a month, quantity demanded outpaced available supply and this model was subsequently marked up at most e-tailers/ retailers. I managed to snag this before it went up to £70-80.

In this case, few units were produced so the overall effect on prices of used CPUs was negligible.

### GPU

GPU pricing has typically been very sensitive to cryptocurrency booms and crashes. Most Bitcoin mining is done using application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) nowadays. The RX 480 released on 29 June 2016 was a great card, but shortly thereafter, cryptocurrency mining, especially Ethereum mining, became extremely profitable. Miners could recoup the cost of investment within 30 days and make pure profit from then on.

### RAM / NAND / Solid-state memory

This market is heavily vulnerable to cycles of price inflation and deflation. The main NAND manufacturers are Samsung, Micron, and SK Hynix. They've been found guilty of price fixing/ non-competition schemes in the past. Supply production is typically set months in advance, so they are sensitive
