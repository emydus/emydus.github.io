For people that haven't been following the recent rise of AMD Ryzen CPUs in personal computing, AMD has basically come along and given the industry a massive wake-up call. Their main competitor, Intel, had been peddling 4C/8T (4-Core/8-Thread) CPUs as the top-end for consumers since 2010 up to the announcement of Ryzen.

AMD's new offerings are fantastic for what they are, but there's something to be said for buying secondhand. New product releases are typically associated with greater performance at a given price (Nvidia GPU pricing notwithstanding), and this pushes down price for used parts in that segment.

I will share some notable "good deals" of the last 3 years in the United Kingdom that have affected pricing in some segments of the new/ used parts market.

### CPU

Intel released a 2 core / 4 thread (2C/4T) budget CPU, the Pentium G4560, in Q1 2017. It offered such good value at it's MSRP of £55 that within a month, quantity demanded outpaced available supply and this model was subsequently marked up at most e-tailers/ retailers. I managed to snag this before it went up to £70-80.

In this case, few units were produced so the overall effect on prices of used CPUs was negligible.

### GPU

GPU pricing has typically been very sensitive to cryptocurrency booms and crashes. Bitcoin would be the one most people have heard of, but most Bitcoin mining is done using application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) nowadays. The RX 480 released on 29 June 2016 was a great card, but shortly thereafter, cryptocurrency mining, especially Ethereum mining, became extremely profitable. At its peak, miners could recoup their cost of investment within 2-3 weeks and make pure profit from then on by purchasing this card.

### RAM / NAND / Solid-state memory

This market regularly cycles between price inflation and deflation. The main NAND manufacturers are Samsung, Micron, and SK Hynix. They've been found guilty of price fixing/ non-competition schemes in the past. Supply production is typically set months or years in advance, so when there are changes in demand, the quantity produced cannot easily be adjusted.

Anecdotally speaking, most NAND is quite cheap right now. [DRAMeXchange](https://www.dramexchange.com/) is the source most tech-tubers use.
